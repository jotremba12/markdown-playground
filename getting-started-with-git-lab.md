# Getting started with Git Lab
## Instructions
In this lab, we'll be going through some basic tasks you'll need to do as you manage the GitHub repository for your CollectionBuilder site. The questions below are designed to help you learn and remember what you need to do to perform these tasks, as well as where you can go to look for help. 
## Creating your repository and editing files
**What did you click on to create a new repository in the web interface of Github (i.e., on Github.com)?**  
Creating a new repository on the web interface of Github happens when a user logs into git up and finds a small plus dropdown button in the upper right hand corner of the web Github. When the user hovers their mouse over that plus dropdown button, it says "create new..." and the user can click on the button and select "new repository." When adding in the information for a repository, the only required is a repository name and for the user to select if the repository is public or private. Then the user can click the green button that says "Create repository," and the repository will be created.

**What is the difference between a private and a public repository?**  
The difference between a private and a public repository is that a public repository is available for anyone on the internet to see the repository while the user can pick who can commit to the repository. A private repository allows the user to pick who can see the repository as well as who can commit to the repository.

**Once your repository has been made and has at least one file, what button do you need to click on the web interface in order to create a new file in your repository?**  
The user needs to click "create new file" on the Github interface before the file can be made available in the repository. Once the user adds a file name and adds text or code into the file, the user should select "commit changes."

**Describe the steps you took to clone your repository on Github Desktop**  
To clone a repository, the user should open the desktop app for Github and go to the file dropdown menu and select "clone repository..." and select the repository you'd like to clone and hit "clone."

**What is the title of GitHub documentation?**  
The title of the GitHub documentation is called "GitHub Docs" and is located when a user clicks on their profile photo and a menu comes in from the right that has "GitHub Docs" on the bottom right corner that will bring you to documentation help for GitHub tasks.

**What is the URL for GitHub documentation on creating your first repository?**  
https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository

**Where is your local repository versus the remote repository?**  
The local repository is on your desktop, and the remote repository is online at GitHub.com, where we originally made the repository.

**What happens when you fetch?**  
When you fetch on GitHub, the user is looking at their copy of the work that they were doing on the local repository after they made changes without officially pushing those changes to the remote repostory. 

**What happens when you pull changes/commits?**  
Pulling changes/commits means that the user is grabbing whatever changes that others might have done to the copy so that when the user is working, they have the most up to date information or changes that someone else put on the document.

**When working on GitHub Desktop, what order should you generally perform push, pull, and fetch?**  
While working on GitHub Desktop, the user should pull the most up to date document - just in case others made changes or commits. Then the user would make their own edits, they would fetch their changes and review them and then finally, the user would push those changes to the GitHub remote repository.

**What happens when you push commits from your local repository?**  
When the user pushes commits from the local repository to the remote repository, whatever changes were made at the local level are updated in the remote repository. If others are working on the same project, they can now see what different commits you made and continue working on your progress.

**What is the URL for the Github glossary?**  
The URL for the GitHub glossary is https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary. 

**Where can you find a list of your commits?**  
Users can find a list of their commits on their local GitHub repository by selecting their repository and looking at the history of the repository. The user should find all of their commits for their local repository.

**What is the URL for documentation on reverting a commit?**  
The URL for GitHub documentation about reverting a commit could be found at https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/managing-commits/reverting-a-commit-in-github-desktop. 

**How do you revert a commit?**  
To revert a commit, the user would need to right click the commit that they would like to revert, and select "revert changes in commit." The revert would show up as it's own commit and the original commit would remain in the list of commits.

## Git-flavored markdown
**What is the name of the page or URL in GitHub documentation where there's information on how to format your Markdown for GitHub?**  
The page in GitHub documentation where users can find information about formatting Markdown in GitHub is called "Basic Writing and Formatting on Github" and can be found at https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax

**What precedes a second-level heading in Github markdown?**  
To make a second-level heading in GitHub Markdown, two hashtags would have to precede any words for the level. (##)

**How do you indicate text that has been struckthrough?**  
For text that has been struckthrough, you would add two squiggly keys or twiddles (~) before and after the words you would like to strikethrough.

**How do you create a hyperlink in your markdown?**  
To create a hyperlink in the Github flavor of markdown, the user would have to by wrapping link text in brackets [ ], and then wrapping the URL in parentheses ( ). You can also use the keyboard shortcut Command+K to create a link. When you have text selected, you can paste a URL from your clipboard to automatically create a link from the selection.

You can also create a Markdown hyperlink by highlighting the text and using the keyboard shortcut Command+V. If you'd like to replace the text with the link, use the keyboard shortcut Command+Shift+V.

**How do you link to a section in the same or another markdown file?**  
To link to a section in the same or another markdown file, the user would need to link directly to a section in a rendered file by hovering over the section heading to expose a link icon and can grab that link to hyperlink into the document.

**What are the three possible symbols for indicating an unordered list?**  
The three symbols that would need to be a dash, a star, or a plus sign (-, *, +).

**Format the following text into a footnote:**  

Alex Wingate went to William and Mary [^1]. 
[^1]: [William and Mary](https://www.wm.edu/) is a university in Williamsburg, VA founded in 1693.  

Bonus: make “William and Mary” a hyperlink to W&M’s website.
